<h1>WHO AM I? </h1>
<p>
I am Tameka Williams, a cloud-focused IT professional with over a decade of experience supporting military, government, and enterprise environments. Currently serving as a Cloud Computing Engineer for the U.S. Air Force, I specialize in architecting and securing AWS and Azure IL6 environments for mission-critical operations.

My career has been built on a foundation of cybersecurity, DevOps automation, and systems administration, with proven success in deploying Kubernetes clusters, implementing hardened security controls, and leading containerized solutions in air-gapped systems. I hold an active Secret Clearance and a CompTIA Security+ certification, ensuring I can deliver secure, compliant solutions in highly regulated environments.

Beyond the technical side, I’m a trusted leader who has managed $100K+ IT inventories, coordinated cross-department collaboration, and guided teams to strengthen system performance and security posture. Whether it’s building resilient cloud infrastructure, conducting vulnerability assessments, or aligning deployments with DoD and FedRAMP standards, I thrive on solving complex challenges that keep organizations secure and mission-ready.

When I’m not engineering secure cloud solutions, I’m advancing my studies in Computer Science at Auburn University at Montgomery, continuing to expand my expertise in emerging technologies.</p>
